# Define a 'LineDrawer' class
# - It should show a user interface with a Window and a Canvas
# - Moving the mouse over the Canvas should draw a small circle (filled black) at the mouse's position
# Instantiate a LineDrawer object and test the UI to make sure you can draw 'lines' by moving the mouse over the Canvas
