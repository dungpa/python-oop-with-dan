# Define a function which takes a number for an 8-ball
# - Give this function a correct type hint for the integer parameter
# - This function should output a fortune for that number
# - Think of a unique fortune for each possible 8-ball result (from 1 to 8)
#   = Examples are:
#       == "You have good luck"
#       == "Avoid the colour purple"
#       == "Good fortune follows you today"
#       == "Not likely"
#       == "Aim for your goals today"
#       == "This is a fortune"
#       == "You have bad luck today"
#       == "The skies will be clear for you"
# Call this function using all 8 possible results to test (using a for loop and a range)
