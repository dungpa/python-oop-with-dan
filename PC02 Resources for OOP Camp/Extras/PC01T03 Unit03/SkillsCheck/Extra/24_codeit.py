# Define a function which takes a list of words for a sentence and outputs the 'Pig Latin' form of it
# - Give this function a correct type hint for the list of strings parameter
# - The function should iterate through every word in the list
#   = For each word, it should perform these changes
#       == A hyphen - should be added at the end of the word
#       == The first letter of the word should be moved from the beginning to the end of the word
#       == The letters 'ay' should be added to the end of the word
#   = After making these changes, output the word to the console
# Call this function to test
#   = For example, if the sentence ["this", "tests", "the", "function"] is used, the output would be:
#       his-tay
#       ests-tay
#       he-tay
#       unction-fay
