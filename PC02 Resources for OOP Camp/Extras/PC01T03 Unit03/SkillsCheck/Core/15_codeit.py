# Define a function which takes a list of float values
# - Give this function a correct type hint for the float list parameter
# - The function should shuffle the list 1000 times
#   = For each shuffle, choose two random indexes in the list
#   = Swap the values of those two elements around
#       == You can swap values by creating a temporary variable
#       == Assign the first element to the temporary variable
#       == Assign the second element to the first element
#       == Assign the temporary variable to the second element
# Call this function with a list of integers and output that list to test
