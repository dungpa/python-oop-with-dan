# Define a function which takes a total weight of some items to send in some packages
# - Give this function a correct type hint for its weight parameter
# - This function should output the number of 'Large' and 'Small' packages required for the total weight
#   = Large packages can only hold up to 10kg
#   = Small packages can only hold up to 4kg
# - Find the total number of Large packages required first
#   = Subtract the 'Large' weight from the total weight for each package used
# - Then find the total number of Small packages required
# Call this function with a total weight of 39 to see the number of Large/Small packages required
