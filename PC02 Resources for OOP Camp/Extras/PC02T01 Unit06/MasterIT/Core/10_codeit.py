# Define a Money class with a float parameter and instance variable for the amount of money to start
# Override the add and string dunder functions
# - the add dunder function should take another Money object and return a Money object with the amounts added together
# - the string dunder function should output the amount in this format: Â£13.20
#   (don't worry about having more or less decimal places)
# Test the Money class by instantiating two Money objects (with any starting amounts), output them, then output the addition of them
