# Define a Recipe class with instance variables for its name (string) and a list of steps to complete the recipe (list of strings)
# - Assign both instance variables values using parameters from the constructor
# Define the following instance functions in this class
# - read_instructions: outputs the Recipe's instructions, step by step, to the console, letting the user press Enter to continue on to the next step
#   = You can use a blank input() to make the user press input before continuing with the program
# - get_number_of_instructions: returns the number of instructions that the Recipe has
# Instantiate a Recipe object (giving it any name and list of steps) and call its read_instructions() and get_number_of_instructions() functions to test them
