# Define a WaterBottle class with an instance variable for an amount of water in it and a max capacity
# - Assign these instance variables a value using parameters in a constructor
# Add the string dunder function to output the amount of water in the bottle neatly (in millilitres, ml)
# Define the following instance functions in this class
# - drink: takes a float amount for the amount to drink; remove that from the amount variable
#   = Set the amount to 0 if it goes below 0 (as you can't have a negative amount of water in a bottle)
# - fill: takes a float amount for the amount of water to put into the bottle
#   = Set the amount to the max capacity if it goes above the max capacity (as the water would spill out the bottle)
# Instantiate a WaterBottle object (with any starting/max amount) and call its drink and fill functions to test
