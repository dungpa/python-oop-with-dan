# Define a function which accepts a list of float values as a parameter
# - This function should sort the parameter list using the Bubble Sort method
# Create a list of these numbers: [6, 1, 3, 9, 7, 2, 4, 3, 5, 9, 10]
# - Output this list before/after sorting them using your function to test
#
# To perform the Bubble Sort method for sorting numbers:
# - Repeat these steps for every element in the list
#   - Loop through all the elements from the list except for the last one
#       - For each element, check if the current element is greater than the next element
#           - If so, swap the current and next elements in the list
