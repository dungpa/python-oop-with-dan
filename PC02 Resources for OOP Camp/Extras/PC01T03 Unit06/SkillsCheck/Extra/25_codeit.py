# Define a function which takes a list of fruit
# - It should sort this list so that the following rules are followed:
#   = All "apples" come first
#   = Next are all "bananas"
#   = Finally are all "cherries"
# Create this list of fruit: ["apple", "cherry", "cherry", "banana", "apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "banana"]
# - Output this list before/after sorting it using your function to test
