# Define a function that takes a list of strings as a parameter
# - It should return the first string that repeats (has the same value twice in a row)
# - If no string repeats, it should return "NO REPEATS" instead
# Call this function twice and output the result to test
# - The first time with this list: ["shoe", "shirt", "sock", "skirt", "hat", "hat", "ring", "glove"]
# - The second time with this list: ["red", "purple", "green", "orange", "blue", "yellow"]
