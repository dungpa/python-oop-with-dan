# - The function should repeatedly ask the user if they want to swap the position of two elements in the list
#   = If they do, ask them for the indexes of the two elements to swap
#   = The function should then swap their position
# - If the user inputs "quit", the function should end
# Create this list of words: ["tact", "code", "fall", "heft", "carp"]
