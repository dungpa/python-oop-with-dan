# Define a function which takes two integer parameters (for the type of dice to roll, and the number of dice to roll)
# - The type of dice to roll is the number of sides that dice will have (e.g. 6 for a 6-sided dice)
# - The function should generate the correct amount of random numbers for each dice roll
#   = Each roll should be output to the console in the format: "Roll {count}, {result}"
# - The function should then return the total of all the dice rolls
# Call this function for rolling 10 6-sided dice to test
