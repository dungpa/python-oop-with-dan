# Define an abstract class called Sport with:
# - A constructor which requires a parameter for the Sport's name, which is assigned to an instance variable
# - An abstract function called show_rules()
# Define two child classes for two Sports (like Football, Tennis, Rugby, Badminton, Squash, etc.)
# - In both child classes, override the constructor and override the show_rules() function
#   = For the constructor, call the Sport class's constructor using the sport's name as the argument
#   = For show_rules, output the rules of that game
#   = For example:
#       == Football: teams win by scoring goals, the most number of goals wins | a goal is scored by kicking a
#                    football into the opposite team's goal
#       == Tennis: players/teams win by scoring enough points to win games/sets | each game has a set number of points
#                  to be won, and each set is made up of a set number of games
# Instantiate an object of both child classes and call their show_rules() function to test
