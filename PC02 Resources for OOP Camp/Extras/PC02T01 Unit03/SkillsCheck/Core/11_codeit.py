# Define the following functions:
#   - my_square: takes a number (integer) and returns the square of it
#   - average: takes two numbers (integers) and returns the average of them (add and divide by 2)
#   - find_largest: takes a list of numbers (integers) and outputs the biggest number in the list
# Call these three functions using these values and print the returned value
#   - my_square(4), which should return 16
#   - average(10, 30), which should return 20
#   - find_largest([60, 100, -40]), which should return 100
