# Fix the errors in this program
# - It defines a Window class
# - Then it instantiates a Window object, assigning it to a variable
# - The following instance variables are declared in the Window object
#   = size, giving it a value of 20
#   = shape, giving it a value of "rectangle"
# - It checks if the Window object's size instance variable is greater than 10
# - If so, it outputs "The main window is large"
# - If not, it outputs "The main window is small"
# - Finally, it outputs "The main window is shaped like a #" (outputting the Window object's shape instance variable)
