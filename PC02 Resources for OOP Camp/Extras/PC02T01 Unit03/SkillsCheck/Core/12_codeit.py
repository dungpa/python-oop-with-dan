# Define a Quiz class
# Instantiate a Quiz object
# Give it instance variables for a question (string) and a list of possible answers (strings)
# For example:
#   - question = "What programming language are we using?"
#   - possible answers = ["Python", "C++", "Java"]
# Show the question/possible answers to the user and see if they enter the correct answer
#   If so, output "Well done!"
#   If not, output the correct answer
