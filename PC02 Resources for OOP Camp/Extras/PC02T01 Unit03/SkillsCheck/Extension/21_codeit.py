# Define a function called shuffle
# - It takes a list of values and a number of swaps to perform as arguments
# - It then loops for the correct number of swaps to make
#   = For each loop, select two random indexes in the list
#   = Swap the values at those indexes around
# Create a list and let the user input values until they input "quit"
# Output this list, shuffle it using the function you made, and output it again
