# Define a function called contains
# - It takes two parameters, a 'word' and a 'search' (both strings)
# - It should return True if the 'search' string can be made using the 'word' string
#   = This means every letter in 'search' can be found in 'word'
# Call this function three times, using these arguments:
# - word = "programming", search = "program"    (should return True)
# - word = "science", search = "nice"           (should return True)
# - word = "computer", search = "laptop"        (should return False)
# Output the result of the function calls
