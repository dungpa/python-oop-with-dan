# Define a class called 'TickerProgram'
# - Give this class an instance variable for the current 'tick_count' (starting at 0)
# - When instantiated, this class should show a UI with
#   = A Label which shows the 'tick_count'
#   = A Button which increments the 'tick_count' and shows the new 'tick_count' in the Label when clicked
# - Define an instance function which shows this UI
# Instantiate a 'TickerProgram' object and call the correct function to show this UI and test
