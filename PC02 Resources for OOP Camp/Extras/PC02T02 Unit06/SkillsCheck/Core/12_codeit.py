# Define a class called 'FortuneProgram'
# - When instantiated, this class should show a UI with
#   = A Label which shows a random fortune
#   = A Button which changes the fortune shown in Label when clicked
#       == Think of at least three different possible fortunes and pick one randomly, for example:
#           "The weather will be clear today"
#           "Good luck"
#           "Much money will come your way"
#           "Patience is its own reward"
#       == Set this chosen fortune as the Label's text
# - Define an instance function which shows this UI
# Instantiate a 'FortuneProgram' object and call the correct function to show this UI and test
