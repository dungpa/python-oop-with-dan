# Define a class called 'PasswordProgram'
# - Give the class an instance variable for the list of Button numbers (from 1 to 4) which starts empty
# - When instantiated, this class should show a UI with
#   = Four Buttons
#       == Each Button should call their own instance function when clicked
#       == These instance functions should append the numbers 1, 2, 3, or 4 to the 'password' list
#       == When the length of 'password' reaches 4, check if it equals [3, 2, 1, 4]
#           === If so, output "Correct Password" to the console and set 'password' back to an empty list
#           === Otherwise, output "Incorrect Password" to the console and set 'password' back to an empty list
# - Define an instance function which shows this UI
# Instantiate a 'PasswordProgram' object and call the correct function to show this UI and test
