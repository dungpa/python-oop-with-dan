# Define a class called 'QuizProgram'
# - When instantiated, this class should show a UI with
#   = One Label showing a question to the user
#   = Three Buttons, each showing possible answers to the question
#       == Make each Button call an instance function when clicked
#           === The correct answer Button should output "Correct!" to the console
#           === The two incorrect answer Buttons should output "Incorrect, the answer is #" to the console
# - Define an instance function which shows this UI
# Instantiate a 'QuizProgram' object and call the correct function to show this UI and test
