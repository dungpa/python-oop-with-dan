# Define a class called 'ForumPost'
# - When instantiated, this class should show a UI with
#   = One Label/Entry pair for the title of the post
#   = One Label/Entry pair for the contents of the post
#   = One Button which calls an instance function when clicked
#       == This instance function should output the title/contents of the forum post to the console
#       == It should then clear the Labels (give them empty text)
#           === Use 'entry_object.delete(0, tk.END)' to delete all text from an Entry object
# - Define an instance function which shows this UI
# Instantiate a 'ForumPost' object and call the correct function to show this UI and test
