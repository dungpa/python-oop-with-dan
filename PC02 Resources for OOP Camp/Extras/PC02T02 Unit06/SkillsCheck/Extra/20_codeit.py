# Define a class called 'ItemSearcher'
# - Give this class an instance variable for a list of items (strings)
#   = This list must contain at least 5 item names, for example
#       ["Television", "Gaming Computer", "Blender", "School Laptop", "Calculator"]
# - When instantiated, this class should show a UI with
#   = One Label/Entry pair for the name of the item to search for
#   = One Label for the item that the search finds (starts empty)
#   = One Button which calls an instance function when clicked
#       == This instance function should search through the items list for the first item that contains the Entry text
#           === If an item is found, output that item to the Label
#           === Otherwise, output "No item found" to the Label
# - Define an instance function which shows this UI
# Instantiate a 'ItemSearcher' object and call the correct function to show this UI and test
