# Define a function which generates and returns a random hexadecimal string for a colour
# - All hexadecimal colour strings follow the same format
#   = They start with a hash #
#   = They then contain three pairs of hexadecimal digits representing the three main colours: red, green, blue (in that order)
#       == Each hexadecimal digit can range from 0 to F: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F
#       == An example hexadecimal string would be "#FF0022"
# - Give this function a correct type hint for the return value
# Call this function and output the returned random hexadecimal colour
