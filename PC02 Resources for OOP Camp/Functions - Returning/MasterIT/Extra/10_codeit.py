# Define a function which takes two integer parameters for a 'card' and a 'suit'
# - This function should return the string of the card they generate
# - Give this function correct type hints for the parameters and return value
#   = Suits should range from 0 to 3 for "Hearts", "Diamonds", "Clubs", and "Spades"
#   = Cards should range from 0 to 12 for
#       == 0: Ace
#       == 10: Jack
#       == 11: Queen
#       == 12: King
#       == 1 to 9: 2 to 10
#   = For example, if card = 3 and suit = 2, the returned string should be "4 of Clubs"
