# Define a Calculator class
# - Declare instance variables in the constructor for two numbers (floats) and an operator (string)
#   = The operator is for +, -, *, /, or %
# - Add parameters to the constructor for these instance variables
# - Declare an answer instance variable (float) that is the answer to the given numbers/operator
# - Add the __str__ dunder function to output the calculation neatly
#   = E.g. "10 + 2 = 12"
# Instantiate one Calculator object for each possible operation and output them
# - Give each Calculator object the same two numbers, 12 and 5
