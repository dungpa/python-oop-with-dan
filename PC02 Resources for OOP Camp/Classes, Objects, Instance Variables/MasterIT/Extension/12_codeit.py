# Define a Score class
# Create an empty list (where we will store Score objects)
# Create a for loop that repeats 10 times
#   For each iteration instantiate a Score object and give it a 'value' instance variable
#   This 'value' instance variable should be assigned a random integer between 0 and 100
#   Append the Score object to the list after assigning an integer to the 'value' instance variable
