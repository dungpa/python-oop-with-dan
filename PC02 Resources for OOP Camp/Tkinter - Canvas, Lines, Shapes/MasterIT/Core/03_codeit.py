# Define a class called 'PacManDrawer'
# - This class's constructor should create a Window that contains a Canvas (500x500 in size)
#   = The Canvas should draw an arc for PacMan
#       == It's head should start at 45 degrees
#       == And draw the arc for 270 degrees
#       == It should also be yellow: #FFFF00
# - Define a 'start' instance function which shows the Window
# Instantiate a 'PacManDrawer' object and call its start instance function to test
