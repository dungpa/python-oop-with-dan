# Define a class called 'FlowerDrawer'
# - This class's constructor should create a Window that contains a Canvas (500x500 in size)
#   = The Canvas should draw lines/shapes to make a flower
#       == Draw a rectangle for the stem of the flower (green)
#       == Draw an oval for the center of the flower (black)
#       == Draw ovals/arcs for the leaves of the flower (red)
# - Define a 'start' instance function which shows the Window
# Instantiate a 'FlowerDrawer' object and call its start instance function to test
