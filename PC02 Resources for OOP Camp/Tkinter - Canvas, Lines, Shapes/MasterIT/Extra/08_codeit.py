# Define a class called 'CloudDrawer'
# - This class's constructor should create a Window that contains a Canvas (500x500 in size) that has a grey background
#   = The Canvas should draw lines/shapes to make a cloud
#       == The cloud should be made up of multiple ovals
#       == The cloud should be white
# - Define a 'start' instance function which shows the Window
# Instantiate a 'CloudDrawer' object and call its start instance function to test
