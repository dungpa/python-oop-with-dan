# Define a class called 'TableDrawer'
# - This class's constructor should create a Window that contains a Canvas (500x500 in size)
#   = The Canvas should draw lines/shapes to make a table (viewed from the side)
#       == The table needs a tabletop, and two legs
#       == Use a brown colour for the table: #8B4513
# - Define a 'start' instance function which shows the Window
# Instantiate a 'TableDrawer' object and call its start instance function to test
