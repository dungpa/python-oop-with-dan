# Define a function that takes an integer parameter
# It returns True if that integer is a leap year
# Otherwise it returns False
# The rules to define a leap year are:
#   - If the number is divisible by 400, it is a leap year
#   - Otherwise, if the number is divisible by 4 and NOT divisible by 100, it is a leap year
#   - Otherwise, it is not a leap year
