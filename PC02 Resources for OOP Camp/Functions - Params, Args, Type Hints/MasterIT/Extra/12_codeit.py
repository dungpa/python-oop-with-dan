# Define a function which takes a size parameter (integer) and a shape type parameter (integer)
# - Shape types include the following
#   = 0 for rectangle
#   = 1 for right-angled triangle
#   = 2 for diamond
# - The function should output the correct shape of the correct size
# Call this function three times (for all three shape types) to test
