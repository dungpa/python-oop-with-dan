# Define a function which asks the user for a number and 'flips' that many coins
# - Validate the number so it is an integer greater than 1
# - The function should record the number of 'Heads' and 'Tails' flips
#   = It should then output these totals at the end of the function
#   = It should also output which side (Heads/Tails) had the largest total
