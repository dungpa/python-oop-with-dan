# Define a RockPaperScissors class with the following instance variables
# - player_1_score: the score for the first player (starting at 0)
# - player_2_score: the score for the second player (starting at 0)
# Define a play instance function which plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors
#   = Ask player 1 for their throw (Rock/Paper/Scissors)
#   = Ask player 2 for their throw (Rock/Paper/Scissors)
#   = Check who won or if there was a draw
#       == Rock beats Scissors
#       == Scissors beats Paper
#       == Paper beats Rock
#   = If a player won, increase their score by 1
# Add docstring comments to the class/constructor/instance function with proper descriptions
#
# To test this class, instantiate a RockPaperScissors object and call its play function 5 times
# - Output the player_1_score instance variable
# - Then output the player_2_score instance variable
# - Finally, output who won or if there was a draw
#   = The winner will have the larger score
#   = A draw means both players will have the same score
