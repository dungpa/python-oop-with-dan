# Define a 'PasswordCombination' class
# - Give it a constructor which takes a parameter for a list of strings
#   = Store this in a private instance variable called 'combination'
# - Define a getter which returns this combination private instance variable
# - Define a setter which takes two parameters for the current, and a new list of strings
#   = If the current 'combination' list matches the parameter list exactly, assign the new list of strings to the 'combination' instance variable
#       == Exact match means the lists must be the same length, and they must have the same elements in the same order
#
# Instantiate a 'PasswordCombination' object and give it a list of three words (any words)
# - Use the getter to output the combination instance variable
# - Use the setter to change the combination to a different list of four words, but use an incorrect current combination
# - Use the getter to output the combination again (to make sure it wasn't changed after the incorrect current combination was used)
# - Use the setter to change the combination to a different list of four words, this time using the correct current combination
# - Use the getter to output the combination again (to make sure it was correctly changed this time)
