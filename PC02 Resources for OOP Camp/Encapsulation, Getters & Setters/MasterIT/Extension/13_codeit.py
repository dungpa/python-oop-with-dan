# Define a User class with private instance variables for a username (string) and a password (string)
# Define a getter instance function for getting the username
# Define a setter function that takes 4 parameters:
# - The current username
# - The current password
# - The new username
# - The new password
# - Only set the username/password instance variables if the current username/password parameters match
#
# Instantiate a User object with the username "username" and the password "password"
# - Output the username using their getter
# - Call the setter to change the username to "new_username" and the password to "new_password", but use the incorrect previous username/password
# - Output the username using their getter again to make sure it wasn't changed when the incorrect previous username/password were used
# - Call the setter to change the username to "new_username" and the password to "new_password", using the correct previous username/password this time
# - Output the username using their getter again to make sure it were correctly changed
