# Define a Secret class with a private instance variable for a secret (string)
# - Set the instance variable's value through a parameter in the constructor
# Define instance functions for a getter/setter for the secret instance variable
# - The getter should return a string of *s for each letter in the secret
# Instantiate a Secret class with "This is a secret" as the secret"
# - Output the returned value from the getter
# - Change the secret to "New secret" and output the returned value from the getter again
