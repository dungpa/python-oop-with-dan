# Define a 'ShapeOutputProgram' class
# - When instantiated, this class should show a UI with
#   = An Entry object (to input an integer value)
#   = A Button
# - When the Button is clicked, the program should output a triangle of Os to the console
#   = The size of this triangle should be based on the integer input into the Entry object
#   = For example, a size of 5 would make this triangle
#       O
#       OO
#       OOO
#       OOOO
#       OOOOO
# - Define an instance function which shows this UI
# Instantiate a 'ShapeOutputProgram' object and call the correct function to show the UI and test
