# Define a 'RandomColourUI' class
# - When instantiated, this class should show a UI with
#   = A window
#   = A Button
# - When the Button is clicked, the program should:
#   = Generate a random colour
#       == You can create a random colour by building the hexadecimal string one digit at a time (for 6 digits in total)
#       == Start with #
#       == Then randomly add one digit (6 times) from these options:
#           "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"
#   = Set the Button's background colour to this random hexadecimal string
# - Define an instance function which shows this UI
# Instantiate a 'RandomColourUI' object and call the correct function to show the UI and test
