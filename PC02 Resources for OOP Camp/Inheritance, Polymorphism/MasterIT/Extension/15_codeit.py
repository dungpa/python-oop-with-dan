# Define a Chess class with instance variables for
# - rank: the row the chess piece is on (a digit)
# - file: the column the chess piece is on (a letter)
# - symbol: a letter representing the chess piece
#   = P for Pawn
#   = R for Rook
#   = B for Bishop
#   = H for Knight (K is already taken by King, so Knight can use H, for Horse)
#   = Q for Queen
#   = K for King
# Define child classes for each chess piece type
# - Override their constructor to accept rank/file parameters
# - The symbol should be hard coded in the child class's constructor
