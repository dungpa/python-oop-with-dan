Chapter 1
Once upon a time, in a small village surrounded by a dense forest, lived a brave young adventurer named Alex. One sunny morning, Alex decided to explore the mysterious forest. As Alex stepped into the forest, a magical creature appeared. It was a talking rabbit named Rosie.
"Hello, Alex!" Rosie exclaimed. "Would you like to embark on a magical forest adventure with me?"
Excitedly, Alex agreed. Rosie led the way through the forest, and soon they reached a fork in the path. Rosie turned to Alex and said, "Which path should we take, left or right?".
[Left Path choice: go to Chapter 2]
[Right Path choice: go to Chapter 3]

Chapter 2
Alex and Rosie followed the left path and stumbled upon a sparkling river. "Let's cross it!" Rosie said, pointing to a rickety bridge. However, the bridge looked quite unstable.

Chapter 3
Alex and Rosie took the right path and discovered a hidden cave entrance. The cave was dark and mysterious, but Alex wasn't afraid.
Next to the cave entrance was a torch, which they picked up for safe keeping. (Have Torch)

Alex and Rosie decided to find another way to cross the river. As they explored, they discovered a hidden boat near the riverbank. Together, they rowed across the river and continued their adventure.

Chapter 9
As Alex and Rosie ventured deeper into the forest, they stumbled upon a mystical garden filled with colourful flowers and talking animals. They spent hours exploring and playing before deciding it was time to head back home.
(Have Gold Coins) At least they have those old gold coins they found. They make a nice prize for their adventure.

Chapter 10
Alex and Rosie couldn't resist the temptation and decided to take the treasure. As they touched the treasure chest, the dragon suddenly woke up and roared loudly! Frightened, they dropped the treasure and ran out of the cave as fast as they could.
